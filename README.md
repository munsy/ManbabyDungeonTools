## NomadicDungeonTools

This is a fork of ManbabyDungeonTools, which itself is/was a fork of MythicDungeonTools, which was originally called MethodDungeonTools until Josh the Rapist inadvertently forced nnogie to change the name. I changed the name from 'Manbaby' not because the rename isn't good (it's great <3 <3 <3), or because I want credit for adding my own stuff to it, but simply because I'm afraid that if Josh finds out about it he'll try to touch the addon in its naughty places.

## License
GPL 2.0 which means if I EVER decide to be a fucking douchebag and put the mod behind a paywall, you should promptly fork this code and make your own rehost of it. You should also make sure Blizzard knows about my douchebagginess so I'll get a C&D sent to me.
