This is a fork of ManbabyDungeonTools, which itself is/was a fork of MythicDungeonTools, which was originally called MethodDungeonTools until Josh the Rapist forced nnogie to change the name. I changed the name from Manbaby not because the name isn't good, or because I want credit, but because I'm afraid that if Josh finds out he'll try to touch the addon in its naughty places.

Manbaby Dungeon Tools is a Mythic+ Dungeon Planner AddOn which helps you perfectly plan out your strategies and pull patterns in Mythic+ Dungeons. Every NPC in every Shadowlands dungeon has been mapped out and can be viewed on an interactive map. Furthermore you have the option to select these enemies and devide the enemies you wish to defeat into pulls. While going through the dungeon and selecting more enemies the progress bar will fill up and you will know exactly which enemies to kill to reach perfect enemy forces count. When done with selecting enemies the reoute can be exported and shared via a paste string or send to party members ingame so other users of the AddOn can see what you have planned for the dungeon.
