## NomadicDungeonTools

Forked from [DungeonTools](https://github.com/LetsTimeIt/DungeonTools) which was forked from (https://github.com/Nnoggie/MythicDungeonTools). MDT **used** to be completely free but [one day the author decided that not only is it completely unreasonable for people to ask him to update his addon, but that doing so is 'harassment' and the only way to stop being 'harassed' is to put the data behind a paywall](https://streamable.com/86awsk). The community as a whole shouldn't be denied access to what was otherwise a good service on the whims of a petulant child, so the goal here will be to maintain what was already created for us, and to provide updates to the addon when appropriate.
